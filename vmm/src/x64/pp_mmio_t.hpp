    ///   @note IMPORTANT: The most important aspect of this class is it
    ///     gives out T*s (both from the map() and shared_page() functions).
    ///     Each map has to have a unique SPA which is why we have a max number
    ///     of maps and track these maps using the SPA that is provided. This
    ///     is because YOU CANNOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE T* FOR THE SAME ADDRESS.
    ///     If you do, you will violate strict aliasing rules. That's why you
    ///     have to checkout the shared page and then return it. It is also
    ///     why you can only have one map for each SPA. Any code that is
    ///     added to this has to enforce the same rules. Any T* that is given
    ///     needs to be unique. If you need to change T, that is fine, so
    ///     long as T is a POD type, but whoever is using T* for the old T has
    ///     to stop using it (meaning it needs to be released) so that a new
    ///     T* can be created for that same address. Again, if this is not done
    ///     right, strict aliasing rules will be violated. It will also prevent
    ///     constexpr from working as you cannot have the same address point
    ///     to two different types in a constexpr, for the same reasons.
    ///
    ///   @note IMPORTANT: The PP can only handle SPAs. It makes no sense for
    ///     a PP to store or handle a GPA because it has no guest VM to work
    ///     with.
    ///
    ///   @note IMPORTANT: You might be asking, why do we have a unique map
    ///     and a unique shared page. Why not just make them the same thing.
    ///     This is because maps will be created and released, and when they
    ///     are released, the memory is no longer needed. The shared page
    ///     however will be created, and then remapped to different T *s
    ///     all the time, but the memory itself is not actually released until
    ///     clr_shared_page_spa is called. So the unique map frees the
    ///     memory and then tells the m_maps that the SPA it owned is now
    ///     free. The unique shared page simply flips m_shared_page_in_use
    ///     and the memory stays mapped until clr_shared_page_spa is called.
    ///
    ///   @note IMPORTANT: You might also be asking, why not just make all
    ///     maps global? Why do we have a per-VM, per-PP map. The reason each
    ///     map is per-VM, is because the extension (in this case MicroV)
    ///     has a different direct map per VM. This is to deal with
    ///     speculative execution attacks, and ensures that the direct map
    ///     for MicroV is isolated between VMs. The reason maps are also
    ///     on a per-PP is actually for two different reasons. Each PP is
    ///     symmetric, which means that they can execute at the same time,
    ///     with independence. Using a global map would require locks to
    ///     handle this safely. Global maps would also require that when the
    ///     unmap occurres, all PPs are flushed, which would be slow not
    ///     just from the locks that would be required, but the IPIs that
    ///     would also be required to flush all PPs. Per-PP maps means that
    ///     they can map whatever memory they need without an issue, and
    ///     they don't need to notify other PPs when an unmap occurs.
    ///
    ///   @note IMPORTANT: The map function should not be used to map the
    ///     shared page (use set_shared_page_spa for that), or the LAPIC.
    ///     This is because the shared page and LAPIC have different map
    ///     functions. The shared page needs to be handled differently (see
    ///     above for more details), and the LAPIC needs to actually have
    ///     the same address, so this is a global map (that is never unmapped
    ///     so there is no issue here with IPIs), and that is because the
    ///     LAPIC is mapped to the same virtual address on all PPs, even
    ///     though that virtual address talks to the LAPIC associated with
    ///     the PP making the calls. Any attempt to use map() for these
    ///     will result in UB. You have been warned.
